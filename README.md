- 👋 Hi, I’m @HigHt3k
- 👀 I’m interested in Aviation, Data Analytics and Gaming/Esports where I also participate in an amateur team. I try to combine those interest by analysing esports match data in my free time and working as a working student in the field of big data and aviation.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning to develop a Game Engine in JAVA and writing my Master's Thesis in Aerospace Engineering.
- 💞️ I’m currently not looking for any collaborations.
