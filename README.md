- 👋 Hi, I’m @HigHt3k
- 👀 I’m interested in Aviation, Data Analytics and Gaming/Esports where I also participate in an amateur team. I try to combine those interest by analysing esports match data in my free time and working as an aviation engineer with big data.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning to develop a Game Engine in JAVA for my Master's Thesis in Aerospace Engineering.
- 💞️ I’m currently not looking for any collaborations. However, you can use my Game Engine ENGINEer (yes, creative name!) if you want to. Just contact me for further info.
- 📫 How to reach me:
